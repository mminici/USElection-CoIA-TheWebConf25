      "0 ---- Joe Biden White House Spins 'Cheap Fakes' to Deflect Attention from Biden's Gaffes https://gorightnews.com/joe-biden-white-house-spins-cheap-fakes-to-deflect-attention-from-bidens-gaffes/ White House creates term 'Cheap Fakes' to confuse obscure Biden gaffes #GoRightNews In a bold attempt to manage the public perception of President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities, the White House has coined a new term: \"cheap fakes.\" This term appears designed to dismiss viral clips highlighting Biden's frequent gaffes as bad faith attacks rather than genuine concerns. For some time, Biden's cognitive capabilities have been a topic of discussion, with increasing scrutiny since he assumed office. The challenge for his administration has only grown, given the president's almost daily public missteps. Notable incidents include his disoriented behavior at the G7 Summit, an inappropriate interaction with the Pope, and requiring assistance from former President Obama to exit a stage at a fundraiser. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre recently introduced \"cheap fakes\" during a press briefing. She explained that the term refers to videos shared with the intent to mislead the public into believing that Biden is suffering from cognitive decline. Jean-Pierre asserted, \"They are cheap fakes videos. They are done in bad faith... The right-wing critics of the president have a credibility problem.\" The term \"cheap fakes\" seems deliberately chosen to sound similar to \"deep fakes\"—AI-generated videos that create entirely fictitious scenarios. This choice likely aims to confuse the public, suggesting that these videos of Biden are also digitally manipulated, thus undermining their authenticity. Public sentiment, however, remains skeptical. A recent poll revealed that 63% of Americans lack confidence in Biden's mental fitness. More strikingly, even within his own party, 32% of Democrats share this lack of confidence. From a constitutionalist perspective, the administration's tactics appear to be a desperate move to obscure the truth and manipulate public perception. This strategy raises concerns about transparency and accountability in leadership. As the administration struggles to address and manage these public concerns about Biden's mental acuity, it is expected that their defensive rhetoric and accusations against critics will only intensify. This trend highlights a broader issue within our governance, where the need for genuine dialogue and accountability is often overshadowed by partisan strategies and media manipulation.

      "1 ---- The Misguided \"America First\" Movement: A Constitutional Republic Perspective #GoRightNews The so-called \"America First\" event organized by Nick Fuentes has garnered significant attention, yet it fails to live up to its name. Promoted as a patriotic gathering, it is instead dominated by far-right, ultra-Zionist religious extremists who blatantly disregard the core principles of our Constitutional Republic. These individuals claim to champion American values but seem fundamentally disconnected from the true essence of our Constitution and its guarantee of democracy. The movement purports to place America first, yet it does little to further a genuine constitutional agenda. This is a recurring issue with significant political movements like the Tea Party, the original America First movement, and MAGA, which have all been infiltrated and distorted by the far-right religious faction. Fuentes' event is a stark reminder of how these movements can be co-opted by fringe elements, undermining their original intents. True constitutionalists for liberty recognize that America is inherently diverse, reflecting a broad spectrum of cultures and ideas. By ignoring this diversity, the far-right elements not only misrepresent American values but also fail to support the real America First movement that aligns with constitutional principles. The issue of antisemitism is often manipulated by extremists on both ends of the political spectrum. It is critical to acknowledge that any group—whether defined by religion, race, sexuality, or other characteristics—can have individuals or factions that cast a negative light on the whole. Far-right and far-left groups, along with certain media outlets, can exacerbate this by promoting misinformation that unfairly stereotypes entire communities. It is not inherently antisemitic, racist, sexist, or homophobic to criticize the actions of individuals within a group, provided the criticism does not generalize or incite hatred against the group as a whole. In a revealing twist, both far-left extremists and far-right extremists often find common ground in their opposition to Israel. This convergence underscores a broader political truth: extreme ideologies, regardless of their initial direction, eventually circle back to share similarities with their supposed opposites. This phenomenon highlights the importance of maintaining a moderate, constitutionally grounded perspective that upholds the principles of liberty and democracy without veering into extremist rhetoric or actions. In conclusion, the \"America First\" event, as orchestrated by Nick Fuentes, exemplifies the dangers of far-right infiltration into political movements aimed at upholding constitutional values. True patriotism requires a commitment to the diversity and democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution, not the narrow, exclusionary vision promoted by extremist factions.\n",
      "2 ---- Hunter Biden Found Guilty All Charges Hunter Biden has been found guilty on all charges in his federal gun trial, highlighting the ongoing legal issues surrounding the Biden family. Many in conservative circles argue this conviction serves as a distraction from the more significant alleged crimes of the Biden family. In October 2018, Hunter Biden falsified information on his firearm application, denying his drug use at the time. Despite his lawyer's claims that he was sober, substantial evidence, including photos and text messages, contradicted this assertion. The 12-person jury swiftly returned their verdict after just three hours of deliberation, finding Hunter Biden guilty on three counts: 1. Making false statements while purchasing a firearm 2. Making false statements regarding information kept by federal firearms licensed dealers 3. Unlawful possession of a firearm This conviction marks a historic moment as Hunter Biden becomes the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of criminal charges. ### The Consequences Hunter Biden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and fines up to $750,000. However, legal experts anticipate he will serve only a fraction of this sentence, if any time at all. President Joe Biden stated he would not pardon his son. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt commented: “This trial has been nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family, which has raked in tens of millions of dollars from China, Russia and Ukraine.\" House investigators have indicated that the Biden family has received more than $15 million through dubious business deals in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania, and China. ### Broader Implications Elon Musk weighed in on the situation, writing on X, “He (and others) should be in jail for impugning the integrity of the United States by taking bribes for political favors, but not for this pseudo-crime.” There is a growing sentiment among constitutionalists and moderate conservative Republicans that Hunter Biden is being used as a pawn. This situation ostensibly aims to balance the scales as Democrats pursue legal actions against former President Donald Trump, suggesting the justice system's impartiality.

      "3 ---- Celebrating LGBTQ Progress Amidst Continued Struggles This Pride Month Sacramento's recent Pride parade highlighted the achievements and ongoing challenges of the LGBTQ community, drawing both celebrations and protests. Recognizing and supporting diverse voices is essential for our nation's progress. A Vibrant Celebration The parade, part of a weekend-long Pride Month celebration, saw thousands march from Southside Park to 10th Street near the Capitol. The event was a colorful display of unity and diversity, featuring rainbow flags, political figures, motorcyclists, corgis, Bank of America, and the Sacramento Gay Men’s Chorus. Diverse Opinions For many, the parade was a powerful statement against groups pushing anti-LGBTQ policies, such as forced outing of transgender students in schools. Priya Kumar, a spokeswoman for Sacramento Pride Weekend, emphasized the importance of visibility: \"I think it’s really important for this type of demonstration to be here and be seen, and to show how much it’s grown,\" Kumar said. \"Pride started as a riot. It started as a demonstration against the oppressive forces.\" While some participants welcomed corporate involvement as a sign of support, others, like activist Jessica Lawless, criticized what they view as \"corporate Pride pinkwashing.\" Lawless argued: \"We must move beyond the politics of visibility. Because visibility to what end?\" Personal Stories Bruce and Deb Lumbert from Reno brought signs that said, “God blessed us with a gay son. Now let our son bless us with a son-in-law.” and “We are getting a son-in-law.” celebrating their gay son and his upcoming marriage, reflecting their long-standing support for LGBTQ rights. Bruce noted that \"Star Trek\" star George Takei had autographed their sign during protests against California's Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot measure banning same-sex marriage. Deb Lumbert expressed cautious optimism: \"The situation for LGBTQ people has gotten better, but I don’t want to see it get worse. That’s what we’re afraid of.\" Their son, Nick Kimutis, who lives in Sacramento and is preparing to marry his fiancé Brian Young, shared his gratitude for living in a state that supports LGBTQ rights, while acknowledging the challenges faced elsewhere. Political Context While Pride Month celebrates diversity and progress, it also highlights the complexities of the political landscape. Despite the perception that the LGBTQ community leans towards leftist politics, there is significant diversity within the community, including Republican, Libertarian, and moderate voices. Editors Note: As a Constitutionalist for Liberty, founder of Gays For Trump, and advocate for right-leaning LGBTQ Americans, it is crucial to have a seat at the table in the Republican Party. We must address internalized homophobia within the party and resist efforts from the left that do not prioritize the LGBTQ community's best interests. In Pride Month, celebrating contributors from the LGBTQ community can inspire us to embrace diversity and eliminate bigotry. By fostering inclusivity and rejecting hatred, we can create a society as bright and diverse as the rainbow itself.

      "4 ---- Rising Costs Highlight Challenges for American Families Cost of rent, energy, and other essentials surged in May In an alarming trend, the cost of essentials such as rent, energy, and groceries continues to surge, underscoring the persistent financial challenges faced by American families. While the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a slight stabilization, the specifics reveal a stark reality of escalating living expenses in our Constitutional Republic. Analyzing the Numbers The CPI indicated a 3.3% rise in overall inflation compared to the previous year. Although this marks a slight decrease from April's 3.4% and a significant drop from the 9.1% peak in June 2022, it remains well above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. This persistent inflation underscores the ongoing economic strain on American households. Historical Context It's noteworthy that during the four years of Donald Trump's presidency, the average inflation rate was maintained at a modest 1.9%. This comparison highlights a more stable economic period and suggests a need for policies that can effectively manage inflation without compromising the financial well-being of citizens. Essential Expenses on the Rise A closer examination of the May report reveals substantial increases in essential costs: 🏢 Rent: Up by 5.4% 🏠 Mortgage: Up by 5.6% 🏥 Hospital services: Up by 7.2% 🚙 Car insurance: Up by 20.3% 💡 Electricity: Up by 5.9% 🍔 Ground beef: Up by 4.9% 🥩 Steak: Up by 5.7% 🥓 Bacon: Up by 6.9% 🌭 Hot dogs: Up by 7.3% These increases in essential goods and services strain the budgets of American families, making everyday living increasingly unaffordable. Public Sentiment A recent poll reflects the public's discontent, with only 31% of voters approving of President Biden's handling of inflation, while a significant 61% disapprove. This sentiment underscores the urgent need for effective economic policies that address the real concerns of the populace. Administration's Response The Biden administration continues to assert progress in combating inflation. A statement from the White House on social media claimed: \"Today’s report shows continued progress in lowering inflation. President Biden knows that costs are still too high for many families and we still have a lot more to do. That’s why he will keep fighting to lower drug costs, grocery prices, and energy bills.\" Critical Perspective However, many Americans find these assurances lacking. The everyday experience at grocery stores and gas stations starkly contrasts with the administration's optimistic declarations, leading to a disconnect between government rhetoric and public reality. As a Constitutional Republic dedicated to ensuring democracy and the well-being of its citizens, it is imperative that our government implements policies that stabilize the economy and reduce the financial burden on American families. The rising costs of essential goods and services are a pressing concern that requires immediate and effective action to safeguard the economic future of our nation.

      "5 ---- Youth Vote Shifts Toward Trump in 2024 Election https://gorightnews.com/youth-vote-shifts-toward-trump-in-2024-election/ Maybe the kids are alright... #GoRightNews Recent polls indicate a surprising trend: young voters are warming to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The question arises: Are these voters aligning with Trump’s policies, or is President Biden driving them away? The answer might lie in a combination of both factors. Polling Data Reveals Shift According to the latest New York Times poll, young voters aged 18 to 29 favor Biden by a slim margin of two points, 47% to 45%. A Quinnipiac poll shows Trump leading Biden among voters aged 18 to 34, 48% to 47%. This is a stark contrast to the 2020 presidential election, where Joe Biden secured the youth vote by a significant 24%. The last time a Republican won this demographic was in 1988. Biden’s Struggling Message Aidan Kohn-Murphy, founder of Gen Z for Change—a group that supported Biden in 2020—stated in the Washington Post, “Biden is out of step with young people on a number of key issues.\" Key issues where Biden seems to be losing support include: The War in Gaza: A majority of young voters, 51%, support the Palestinians, while only 15% support Israel. TikTok Ban: Biden's support for a TikTok ban is perceived as an attack on free speech. Consequently, 67% of Gen Z voters say this makes them less likely to vote for him. Economic Challenges: High inflation and interest rates have made essential costs like food and housing unaffordable for young people entering the workforce or trying to purchase their first home. Trump’s Resonating Message The 45th president’s message appears to be resonating with young voters for several reasons: Gaza Conflict: While Trump supports Israel, he promises to bring a peaceful end to the conflict, citing his administration's four years of peace as evidence of his capability. TikTok Engagement: Trump recently joined TikTok, emphasizing that Biden wants to shut the platform down, thus appealing to younger users. Economic Performance: When asked about Trump’s handling of the economy, 65% of young voters approved, compared to just 33% for Biden. Social Media Dynamics According to CredoIQ, a social media analytics firm, nearly 25% of the top left-leaning content creators on TikTok have posted anti-Biden content in the first four months of 2024, garnering over 100 million views. This content is often created by young, non-white liberals who share the belief that the U.S. Government, and specifically Joe Biden, aims to restrict free speech and information flow. Trump’s Adaptation to New Media In 2016, Trump broke political norms with an 'anyplace, anytime' approach, dominating cable TV. For the 2024 campaign, he has adapted this strategy to new media, appearing on podcasts, YouTube shows, and attending live events such as UFC and Formula 1. He has also made campaign stops at local venues, including bodegas, firehouses, and even in the South Bronx. The shift in the youth vote suggests a significant realignment in political affiliations, one that underscores the importance of addressing the issues most pertinent to young Americans. This analysis highlights the potential impact of these changing dynamics on the upcoming presidential election.
